# Self-Evaluation
* I feel decently confident. I don't have the terms memorized yet, so I'm worried about being able to recall them.
* I would like to understand Ruby language (when to use "puts" vs when to just type the code). I'm still unclear on what the difference is between syntax and language for Ruby and irb. I think there's a difference, just not sure. I'm probably more comfortable with irb at this point.
* No questions yet re: arrays!
